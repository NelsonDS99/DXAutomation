Guide to GeneXpert Dx Automation
================================
The Setup:
Import all the necessary libraries needed: (These libraries should be automatically imported when creating a silk test project)
	The JRE
	Silk Test JTF
	JUnit 4
The Apache Library (A folder called common libraries will have these libraries)
	commons-collection4-4.3
	commons-compress-1.18
	junit-4.12
	log4j-1.2.17
	poi-4.1.0
	xmlbeans-3.1.0
Ensure the references are correct to these libraries 
	RightClick Project --> Build Path --> Configure Libraries 
Confirm that the data files have the correct path
	Located in any of the verification demo, under FileInputStream
Confirm the html result files are saved in the correct path
	Under the htmlCreator class
If ever prompt on how to run the verification code, click Silk4J Test
======================================
Excel Format
	Any of the excel verification worksheets in Silk Data files that have been used in the corresponding verification demos are proper templates
	Melt Verification is unique due to having melt peak data values in the analyte sheets
	*Do Not switch around column values in future sheets, as the code will pull the wrong data when doing verification
		Or change the code if need be to pull the correct column values
=========================================
When running the code do not have any DX pop ups open.
Do not touch the mouse if running a verification test, only if you are trying to stop the test
Have the proper data injection files in DX when running the specific data injection verification
========================================
Classes
	Locators- Has the strings of the Dx objects in which the program can locate the specified objects
		If adding more objects use the locator spy to map the objects
	Basic Dx - Returns the specified objects in order to call methods from said objects
================
Left To Do
	XSSF methods - For modern excel files
	Multicart Verification
